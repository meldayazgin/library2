The Library Automation System is a web application developed as a term project for the Software Project Management course at Ya≈üar University. It automates library operations such as user registration, book borrowing and returning, due date tracking, and fine calculation. Built with React.js and Firebase, the system provides a responsive frontend and a real-time Firestore database for managing books and users. Users can view books, borrow or return them, and track their activity via a personal dashboard, while librarians can add, edit, or delete books through a dedicated admin page.

Fines of $1 per overdue day are calculated automatically and updated in the database. Firebase handles authentication and role-based access, ensuring only librarians can manage book data. The system supports real-time updates, notifications for due or overdue books, and persists user sessions across reloads. Development followed a clear project plan with defined milestones, detailed requirements, and testing to ensure functionality. The project can be run locally with npm install and npm start, and Firebase must be configured separately using the provided firebase-config.js file.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
